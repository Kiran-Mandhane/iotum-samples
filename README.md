- These sample apps were made to enhance iotum's Secure Chat SDK to show customers how they could integrate iotum's Secure Chat into their apps. 
- Each folder in the main branch has the code for a different sample app.
- The url for any sample app is https://iotum.github.io/iotum-samples/[nameOfFolder]'

  
- Each sample app first opens to a page where clients enter their SSO token and hostId. This allows clients to see the web app as if it were their own account.
