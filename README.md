- These sample apps were made to enhance iotum's Secure Chat SDK to show clients how they could inegrate iotum's chat widget into their apps. 
- Each folder in the main branch has the code for a different sample app.
- The url for any sample app is https://iotum.github.io/iotum-samples/[nameOfFolder]
- Each sample app opens to a page where clients enter their SSO token and hostId (provided by iotum). This allows clients to see the app as if it were their own account.
